Update:
Trying to get it working on openhab-v2.5.12


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OLD:
## openhab2_pub_001

## based on OpenHAB2 2.4.0+ using JSR223 Javascript for rules. You need a current openhab2-2.4.0.* snapshot to run, due to changes in the JSR223 Scripting engine. 

**this is a work in progress, don't hesitate to file issues for any questions / bugs / ideas or contact me over at the OpenHAB community site https://community.openhab.org/t/hacking-basicui-my-basicui-theme-update/45850**

Due to popular demand i just put up my current config as is, there may be a few unfinished things but all in all it's a pretty decent and stable openhab setup. I (hopefully) redacted all personal info with "XXXXXX" or "123456", you should replace those. There are no .rules because Xtext DSL sucks. There's probably a bunch of unused stuff too, idk.. I might clean up later, Enjoy!
